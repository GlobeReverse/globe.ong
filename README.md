## GUI PreviewModified Discord Bio
So, I found a website for [this template](https://github.com/theosanct0s/discord.bio) for a nice smooth discord bio website that was published on github. However, my main concern was that for a simple bio page that is published on github majority of the javascript is obfuscated (for simple websockets is crazy), basically I remade all the javascript and I have added a click to enter screen that then plays music after clicking.
