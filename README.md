## Modified Discord Bio
So, basically I found a website for [this template](https://github.com/theosanct0s/discord.bio), a nice smooth discord bio website that was published on github. However, my main concern was that for a simple bio page that is published on github majority of the javascript is obfuscated (for simple websockets is crazy), basically I remade all the javascript and I have added a click to enter screen that then plays music after clicking.

## How To Setup
Majority of the stuff to configure is in the `config.js` file locatated in `assets/js/config.js`, the rest will be in the index.html file, im not going to show you how to do it becuase its very self explanatory
